# Theory of Arrays and Strings

## Introduction

This repositry provides an overview of the fundamental concepts and theory behind **arrays** and **strings**, two essential data structures used in programming.

---

## Arrays

### Definition
An **array** is a collection of elements, each identified by an index or key, stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays hold multiple values of the same data type.

### Key Characteristics
- Fixed size (static arrays) or dynamic size (dynamic arrays/lists)
- Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations
- Indexed starting from 0 (in most programming languages)
- Efficient for random access using index

### Types of Arrays
- **One-dimensional array**: Linear collection of elements.
- **Multi-dimensional array**: Arrays of arrays (e.g., 2D arrays representing matrices).

### Operations on Arrays
- Accessing elements: `arr[index]`
- Insertion and deletion (can be expensive due to shifting elements)
- Traversal (iterating over elements)
- Searching and sorting

### Applications
- Used for storing data collections
- Implementing other data structures like lists, stacks, queues, etc.

## Strings

### Definition
A **string** is a sequence of characters, usually stored as an array of characters, terminated by a special character (like `\0` in C) or managed as an object in higher-level languages.

### Key Characteristics
- Immutable in some languages (e.g., Python, Java)
- Mutable in others (e.g., C with character arrays)
- Often implemented as arrays of characters internally

### Common Operations
- Concatenation (joining two strings)
- Substring extraction
- Searching (finding a character or substring)
- Comparison
- Length calculation

### Representation
- Null-terminated character arrays (in languages like C)
- Objects with metadata like length and capacity (in higher-level languages)

### Applications
- Text processing
- User input/output handling
- Parsing and data manipulation

## Summary

Arrays and strings are fundamental building blocks in programming, forming the basis for more complex data structures and algorithms. Understanding their theory helps in efficient coding and problem-solving.
